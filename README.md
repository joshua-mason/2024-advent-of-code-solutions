# 2024 Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges, implemented in TypeScript.

## Structure

Each day's solution is contained within its own directory under the `src` folder. For example:
```
src/
    day01/
    day02/
    ...
```

## Running the Solutions

To run a specific day's solution, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the TypeScript file using `ts-node`:

```bash
cd src/day01
ts-node index.ts
```
